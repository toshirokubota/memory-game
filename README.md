## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript

### What I learned

I continued practicing React. I also tried Typescript this time. I found placing React related types was a bit tedious and time consuming, but I got used to it toward the end.

I also used Tailwind. I think I did better this time than my previous introduction to the tool. I used Tailwind for simple styles that do not have to be responsive and state dependent. More complicated ones, I did it with SCSS separately.

### Continued development

I keep working on the Javascript framework learning path.
